# Natural-Computing-Project
### Recreated the famous boids experiment, but using neural networks for each boid instead of global rules. The neural networks evolve through an Evolutionary Algorithm where crossover techniques and mutations are performed to create a new generation of boids. 

## How to use the code

## Example run
